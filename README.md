Logic Architect for Excel/VBA is a toolset for manipulating tabular data efficiently in Excel VBA which greatly simplifies project development. It has been developed over several years and used on a large number of projects, but is newly loaded to GitHub (November 2025).

The main features are:

- There are extensive facilities for manipulating data on worksheets
- Databases can be created, maintained (including adding new tables) and queried with SQL with simple programming.
- There is a wide range of data transformations using virtual tables, which store data within VBA.
- There is a full object model for use in VBA where parameters are easy to change.
- Methods can be called individually so can be placed where required in VBA code.
- In addition to high level procedures (such as left join, unpivot, etc.) access is also provided to individual records and fields.
- Calculation is done with Excel formulae. Regular Expressions are supported for data extraction.
- User defined functions in VBA are supported.
- It provides an easy way to use SQL on data in the same workbook, to maintain workbook data in an Access database or save it in other formats.
- It is straightforward to create reports and ensure that formulae are protected and formatting is applied.
- It runs on all versions of Excel from 2007 onwards.

Get and Transform in Excel is frequently used to transform data and provides a user interface. If Get and Transform needs to form part of a VBA application, queries can be run from VBA, but if they need to be altered this requires editing the M code created by the Get and Transform user interface. Logic Architect provides most of the transformations which are required in practice in a way which is easier to use in VBA, more flexible and frequently faster. It also uses Excel formulae for calculation and allows VBA access to individual records. 

The Wiki contains the documentation for the system. 

There are four sections:

1. Introduction.
2. Installation.
3. How To. This explains the capabilities of the system and how to use it.
4. Property and Method Reference. This is in alphabetic sequence.

It is recommended to read the first three sections to gain an understanding of what the system offers.

There is also a demo program - originally this was a get and Transform 'challenge', but provides a good demonstration of how this type of data transformation can be carried out straightforwardly using the Logic Architect system.
